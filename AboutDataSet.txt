I have done exploratory Data Analysis on IRIS dataset.

I used univariate Analysis to analyze data for one feature 

I used Bivariate Analysis to analyze data for two features together

I have used different plots to understand the data

I tried pair wise plot to see which features will better help me to classify the targe value
